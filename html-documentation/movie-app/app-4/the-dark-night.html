    <h1>The Dark Knight</h1>
    <p>
      The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan
      from a screenplay he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan. Based on the DC
      Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and the
      second installment in The Dark Knight Trilogy. The film follows the
      vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney
      Harvey Dent as they form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in
      Gotham City. Their efforts are derailed by the intervention of the Joker,
      an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far Batman will go to save
      the city from complete chaos. The ensemble cast includes Christian Bale,
      Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie
      Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. Warner Bros. Pictures prioritized a sequel
      following the successful reinvention of the Batman film series with Batman
      Begins. Nolan developed the core story elements alongside Begins co-writer
      David S. Goyer, making Dent the central protagonist and tragic hero caught
      in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the
      Nolans were influenced by various 1980s Batman comics and crime drama
      films and sought to continue Begins' heightened reality tone. Filming took
      place from April to November 2007, on a $185 million budget, in Chicago,
      Hong Kong, and on sets in England. The Dark Knight was the first major
      motion picture filmed with high-resolution IMAX cameras. Nolan avoided
      using computer-generated imagery unless necessary, insisting on practical
      stunts including flipping an 18-wheel truck and blowing up a factory. The
      Dark Knight was marketed with an innovative interactive viral campaign
      initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who
      believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an
      accidental drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest
      from the press and public regarding his performance. Released in July, The
      Dark Knight broke several box office records and became the
      highest-grossing film of the year, fourth-highest-grossing film of its
      time, and the highest-grossing superhero film. It received critical
      acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances,
      particularly Ledger's. He received several posthumous awards, including
      the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making The Dark Knight the
      first comic book film to receive a major Academy Award. Since its release,
      The Dark Knight has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films
      ever made, one of the best films of the 2000s, and among the best films
      ever made. It is considered the "blueprint" for modern superhero films,
      particularly for rejecting a comic book style for a genre film that
      happens to feature comic book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat
      its success by emulating its gritty and realistic tone to varying degrees
      of success. The Dark Knight has been analyzed for its themes regarding
      terrorism, as well as the limitations of morality and ethics. The United
      States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National
      Film Registry in 2020. A sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, concluded The Dark
      Knight Trilogy in 2012.
