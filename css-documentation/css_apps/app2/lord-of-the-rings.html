            <h3>First Age</h3>
            <p>
              The First Age, often called the Elder Days, was the first
              historical era in Arda that began with the Awakening of the Elves
              in YT 1050 and ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth after the
              War of Wrath, when he was banished from Arda into the Void.

            <h3>Second Age</h3>
            <p>
              The Second Age was the time-period of Arda that began after the
              climactic banishment of Morgoth into the Void by the Lords of the
              West (the Valar) and ended with the defeat of Sauron and his army
              by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, a century after the
              Downfall of NÃºmenor.
